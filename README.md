How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
    Service workers are a tool that can be used towards the objective that graceful degradation aims to do, that is accesibility for the user. Whenever some features may not be available in the browser service workers may be used for their utility to load a page without internet. This overlaps a little with the objective of graceful degradation.
